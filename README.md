# Gravitation
A Simple, C++ N-Body Treecode

## Usage
Makefile included, only c++ compiler needed. Generate initial conditions formatted as in the example _in. file, compile main program and execute using the syntax:
```
./gravitation <IC.in>

```
The Barnes-Hut theta parameter is specified in the _physical_constants.h_ file.

## Aknowledgements
_ConfigFile_ class (used to import an ASCII file for initial conditions and parameters) written by K. Steiner, J. Dominski, N. Ohana, C. Sommariva (EPFL).

This is a personal project mainly desinged for fun and makes no claims of good accuracy.
